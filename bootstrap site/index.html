            <div class="text-primary bg-dark nggat">London is the capital and largest city of England, and the United Kingdom, with a population of around 8.8 million,[1] and the largest city in Western Europe by metropolitan area, with a population of 14.8 million.[9][note 1] It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the North Sea and has been a major settlement for nearly two millennia.[10] The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries.[note 2][11] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th century,[12] the name "London" also refers to the metropolis around this core, historically split among the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[13] which since 1965 has largely comprised Greater London,[14] which is governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority.[note 3][15]

                As one of the world's major global cities,[16] London exerts a strong influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, transport, and communications.[17][18] Despite a post-Brexit exodus of stock listings from the London Stock Exchange,[19] London is still one of Europe's most economically powerful cities,[20] and it remains one of the major financial centres in the world. With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions,[21] it is home to some of the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world—Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London.[22][23] London is the most visited city in Europe and has the busiest city airport system in the world.[24] The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.[25]</div>
